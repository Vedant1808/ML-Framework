# **Sales Prediction System in C**

This is a lightweight and high-performance **machine learning framework** developed entirely in **C programming language**. The project implements a **sales prediction system** based on **linear regression**, demonstrating efficient handling of datasets, training, testing, and performance evaluation without relying on any external libraries.

## **Project Highlights**

### **Custom ML Framework**
- Fully developed in **C** without external libraries, ensuring efficiency and portability.
- Modular design with reusable library files for scalability and future use.

### **Datasets**
- **IceCreamSales.csv**: Predicts daily profits based on temperature data.
- **Insurance.csv**: Predicts insurance charges of patients based on multiple features.

### **Implemented Features and Functionalities**
- **Matrix Operations**: Custom algorithms for matrix shuffling, transformations, and operations.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Conversion of categorical features into numerical format for machine learning.
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Normalization of datasets for improved training performance.
- **Linear Regression Training**: Training the model using vectorization and cost function calculations.
- **Testing and Accuracy Check**: Evaluation using the **RÂ² score** technique.
- **CSV Handling**: Loading datasets from CSV to matrix and exporting results from matrix to CSV.

### **Concepts Used**
- **Vectorization**: Optimized computations for faster training.
- **Cost Function**: Minimizing error during model training.

### **Modular and Reusable Design**
- Each function is compiled into **executable files** and reusable **library files** for flexibility in future projects.
